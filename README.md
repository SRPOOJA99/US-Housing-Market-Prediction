Developed a comprehensive predictive analytics model to accurately estimate housing prices across various regions in the United States. Utilized a rich set of features including geographic location, property size, number of rooms, neighborhood demographics, and prevailing market trends to enhance model accuracy. Applied data preprocessing techniques such as feature engineering, outlier treatment, and normalization to ensure data quality and consistency. Employed machine learning algorithms (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to build robust price prediction models.

Generated interpretable insights through exploratory data analysis and feature importance evaluation, enabling real estate professionals, property developers, and investors to make informed decisions regarding property investments, pricing strategies, and market positioning. The solution not only predicts property values but also highlights key factors influencing market fluctuations, providing stakeholders with actionable intelligence for strategic planning and risk assessment.
